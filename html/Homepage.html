            <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically
                a berry produced by several kinds of large herbaceous 
                flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, 
                bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing
                them from dessert bananas.

            <p>This genus also contains several other species variously referred 
                to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching 
                onion Allium fistulosum, the tree onion Allium proliferum, and the
                Canada onion Allium canadense.

            <p>The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated
                 for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 
                 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury.

            <p>Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. 
                The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans 
                independently in multiple locations, but later genetic studies traced a single 
                origin.
